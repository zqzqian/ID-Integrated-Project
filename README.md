Sign Up Page (index.html)
We made our sign up page that was based off of one of our previous CAs.
Some CSS stylings were applied to fit into the theme of our website.
The "Username" and "Email" fields were made unique, thus users have to enter unique
usernames and emails in order for their information to be updated into the site.

Forum Page (forum.html)
Our forum page has a simple layout that shows the user's profile picture and username when they post.
There is also the title of the post with a larger font-size than the post's content.
The like and comment buttons are also added with every post.
The like counter goes up when the user likes the post.
The comment button opens up a comment overlay where users can see the comment section of the post.
There is also a like button and counter for comments.
